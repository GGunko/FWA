Coding excites me since it feels like a job I would never get tired of, as it combines creativity and problem-solving. At the same time, the demand for computer-related careers continues to grow, making this course both practical and rewarding for the future. Beyond career opportunities, Computer Science also supports my passion for game development, giving me the skills and foundation to turn my hobby into something more meaningful while preparing me for a stable and fulfilling career.",

It all started when I was gifted a Family Computer as my first console, where I spent countless hours playing Super Mario Bros. and Contra. Later on, when I got my first personal computer, I discovered even more games that fueled my passion. The thought of creating games that could inspire and entertain others the way those early games inspired me drives my ambition every day.",
